# Kernel_gcc_patch

This kernel patch adds additional CPU options to the Linux kernel accessible under:
```
 Processor type and features  --->
 Processor family --->
```
## Why a specific patch?
The kernel uses its own set of CFLAGS, KCFLAGS. For example, see:
* [arch/x86/Makefile](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/Makefile)
* [arch/x86/Makefile_32.cpu](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/Makefile_32.cpu)
* [arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu)

# Benchmarks
## Intro
Three different machines running a generic x86-64 kernel and an otherwise identical kernel running with the optimized gcc options were tested using a make based endpoint.

## Conclusion
There are small but real speed increases to running with this patch as judged by a make endpoint. The increases are on par with the speed increase that the upstream sanctioned core2 option gives users, so not including additional options seems somewhat arbitrary to me.

## Details
1. Three test machines: Intel Xeon X3360, Intel i7-2620M, Intel Core i7-3660K.
2. All ran the make benchmark (linked below) 35 times while booted into a 'generic' kernel. Then all ran the same make benchmark 35 times after booting into an optimized kernel. Below are the optimizations chosen for each machine.
	* X3360 = core2
	* i7-2620M = sandybridge
	* i7-3660K = ivybridge
3. Results were analyzed for statistical significance via ANOVA plots that clearly show statistically significant albeit small differences.

## Discussion
1. All the assumptions for ANOVA are met:
	* Data are normally distributed as show in the normal quantile plots.
	* The population variances are fairly equal (Levene and Barlett tests).
2. The ANOVA plots clearly show significance.
	* Pair-wise analysis by Tukey-Kramer shows significance at the 0.05 level for all CPUs compared.

Below are the differences in median values:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>Difference in median value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>core2</td>
    <td>+87.5 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sandybridge</td>
    <td>+79.7 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ivybridge</td>
    <td>+257.2 ms</td>
  </tr>
